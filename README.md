# Project Title

Currently this is a blank template of NestJS deployed on vercel with postgres database on vercel too...
Then, we are bring all portfolio to deployed automated way with continous delivery!

## Stack
NestJS
 TypeORM
Postgres

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following in place:

- **NestJS Application**: Your NestJS application should be ready for deployment.

- **PostgreSQL Database**: Ensure you have access to a PostgreSQL database, whether hosted on Vercel or elsewhere.
    
- **Git Repository**: Your project should be version-controlled within a Git repository.

**Deploy Your Application**: Push your code changes to your Git repository. Vercel will automatically detect these changes and initiate deployments.

**Testing**: After each deployment, thoroughly test your application on Vercel to ensure it successfully connects to the PostgreSQL database.

## Security Considerations

Prioritize the security of your environment variables, especially sensitive information like database credentials, stored on Vercel.

By following these steps, your NestJS application will be deployed on Vercel, securely connecting to a PostgreSQL database using environment variables. Vercel's built-in deployment pipeline will manage automated deployments whenever you make code changes.

Enjoy coding and deploying with ease!
